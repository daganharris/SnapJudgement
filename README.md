# Snap Judgement
This is a program that allows the entry of scores for a photography competition into a database. The program is designed for windows but will function if cross-compiled to Linux or macOS via Mac Catalyst.
# Testing
This program is a .NET MAUI program and thus requires the installation of the .NET MAUI Workload in the Visual Studio Installer. There is no default user built in - you must create a user using the create account button.
